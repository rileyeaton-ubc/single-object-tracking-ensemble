	abstract = {Although not commonly used, correlation filters can track complex objects through rotations, occlusions and other distractions at over 20 times the rate of current state-of-the-art techniques. The oldest and simplest correlation filters use simple templates and generally fail when applied to tracking. More modern approaches such as ASEF and UMACE perform better, but their training needs are poorly suited to tracking. Visual tracking requires robust filters to be trained from a single frame and dynamically adapted as the appearance of the target object changes. This paper presents a new type of correlation filter, a Minimum Output Sum of Squared Error (MOSSE) filter, which produces stable correlation filters when initialized using a single frame. A tracker based upon MOSSE filters is robust to variations in lighting, scale, pose, and nonrigid deformations while operating at 669 frames per second. Occlusion is detected based upon the peak-to-sidelobe ratio, which enables the tracker to pause and resume where it left off when the object reappears.},

	abstract = {Visual tracking is a basic task in many applications. However, the heavy computation and low speed of many recent trackers limit their applications in some computing power restricted scenarios. On the other hand, the simple update scheme of most correlation filter-based trackers restricts their robustness during target deformation and occlusion. In this paper, we explore the update scheme of correlation filter-based trackers and propose an efficient and adaptive training sample update scheme. The training sample extracted in each frame is updated to the training set according to its distance between existing samples measured with a difference hashing algorithm or discarded according to tracking result reliability. In addition, we expand our new tracker to long-term tracking. On the basis of the proposed model updating mechanism, we propose a new tracking state discrimination mechanism to accurately judge tracking failure, and resume tracking after the target is recovered. Experiments on OTB-2015, Temple Color 128 and UAV123 (including UAV20L) demonstrate that our tracker performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers with light computation and runs over 100 fps on desktop computer with Intel i7-8700 CPU(3.2 GHz).},

	abstract = {Robust and accurate visual tracking is one of the most challenging computer vision problems. Due to the inherent lack of training data, a robust approach for constructing a target appearance model is crucial. Recently, discriminatively learned correlation filters (DCF) have been successfully applied to address this problem for tracking. These methods utilize a periodic assumption of the training samples to efficiently learn a classifier on all patches in the target neighborhood. However, the periodic assumption also introduces unwanted boundary effects, which severely degrade the quality of the tracking model. We propose Spatially Regularized Discriminative Correlation Filters (SRDCF) for tracking. A spatial regularization component is introduced in the learning to penalize correlation filter coefficients depending on their spatial location. Our SRDCF formulation allows the correlation filters to be learned on a significantly larger set of negative training samples, without corrupting the positive samples. We further propose an optimization strategy, based on the iterative Gauss-Seidel method, for efficient online learning of our SRDCF. Experiments are performed on four benchmark datasets: OTB-2013, ALOV++, OTB-2015, and VOT2014. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all four datasets. On OTB-2013 and OTB-2015, we obtain an absolute gain of 8.0\% and 8.2\% respectively, in mean overlap precision, compared to the best existing trackers.},

	abstract = {Discriminative Correlation Filters (DCF) are efficient in visual tracking but suffer from unwanted boundary effects. Spatially Regularized DCF (SRDCF) has been suggested to resolve this issue by enforcing spatial penalty on DCF coefficients, which, inevitably, improves the tracking performance at the price of increasing complexity. To tackle online updating, SRDCF formulates its model on multiple training images, further adding difficulties in improving efficiency. In this work, by introducing temporal regularization to SRDCF with single sample, we present our spatial-temporal regularized correlation filters (STRCF). Motivated by online Passive-Agressive (PA) algorithm, we introduce the temporal regularization to SRDCF with single sample, thus resulting in our spatial-temporal regularized correlation filters (STRCF). The STRCF formulation can not only serve as a reasonable approximation to SRDCF with multiple training samples, but also provide a more robust appearance model than SRDCF in the case of large appearance variations. Besides, it can be efficiently solved via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). By incorporating both temporal and spatial regularization, our STRCF can handle boundary effects without much loss in efficiency and achieve superior performance over SRDCF in terms of accuracy and speed. Experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets: OTB-2015, Temple-Color, and VOT-2016. Compared with SRDCF, STRCF with hand-crafted features provides a 5 times speedup and achieves a gain of 5.4\% and 3.6\% AUC score on OTB-2015 and Temple-Color, respectively. Moreover, STRCF combined with CNN features also performs favorably against state-of-the-art CNN-based trackers and achieves an AUC score of 68.3\% on OTB-2015.},

	abstract = {Accurate scale estimation of a target is a challenging research problem in visual object tracking. Most state-of-the-art methods employ an exhaustive scale search to estimate the target size. The exhaustive search strategy is computationally expensive and struggles when encountered with large scale variations. This paper investigates the problem of accurate and robust scale estimation in a tracking-by-detection framework. We propose a novel scale adaptive tracking approach by learning separate discriminative correlation filters for translation and scale estimation. The explicit scale filter is learned online using the target appearance sampled at a set of different scales. Contrary to standard approaches, our method directly learns the appearance change induced by variations in the target scale. Additionally, we investigate strategies to reduce the computational cost of our approach. Extensive experiments are performed on the OTB and the VOT2014 datasets. Compared to the standard exhaustive scale search, our approach achieves a gain of 2.5 percent in average overlap precision on the OTB dataset. Additionally, our method is computationally efficient, operating at a 50 percent higher frame rate compared to the exhaustive scale search. Our method obtains the top rank in performance by outperforming 19 state-of-the-art trackers on OTB and 37 state-of-the-art trackers on VOT2014.},

	abstract = {Discriminative Correlation Filters (DCF) have demonstrated excellent performance for visual object tracking. The key to their success is the ability to efficiently exploit available negative data by including all shifted versions of a training sample. However, the underlying DCF formulation is restricted to single-resolution feature maps, significantly limiting its potential. In this paper, we go beyond the conventional DCF framework and introduce a novel formulation for training continuous convolution filters. We employ an implicit interpolation model to pose the learning problem in the continuous spatial domain. Our proposed formulation enables efficient integration of multi-resolution deep feature maps, leading to superior results on three object tracking benchmarks: OTB-2015 (+5.1\% in mean OP), Temple-Color (+4.6\% in mean OP), and VOT2015 (20\% relative reduction in failure rate). Additionally, our approach is capable of sub-pixel localization, crucial for the task of accurate feature point tracking. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning formulation in extensive feature point tracking experiments.

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds.},

In this paper, we propose a simple but effective ensemble method for MOT, called EnsembleMOT, which merges multiple tracking results from various trackers with spatio-temporal constraints. Meanwhile, several post-processing procedures are applied to filter out abnormal results. Our method is model-independent and doesn't need the learning procedure. What's more, it can easily work in conjunction with other algorithms, e.g., tracklets interpolation. Experiments on the MOT17 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
