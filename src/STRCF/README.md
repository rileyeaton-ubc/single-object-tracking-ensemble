# STRCF Tracker

Make sure you run the `install` command before trying to run STRCF for the first time. You may need to also run `demo_STRCF.m` to properly setup the required paths.

Read the [original README.md](./README_original.md) for more details on STRCF. Many modifications have been made to how the tracker operates, including persistence of the tracking state (object being acquired/lost).
